# Release History

## Versioning Schema

Wirebox is maintained under the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered in the following format:

```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bump the minor (and reset the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch

## LTS - Support Policy

Updates are provided for 12 months for all releases, and security fixes are provided for two years after the next major release.
