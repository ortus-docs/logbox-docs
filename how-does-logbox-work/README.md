# How Does LogBox Work?

LogBox has four main components:

1. LogBox
2. Logger
3. Appenders
4. Layouts. 

These four (4) components work in unison to deliver the logging and tracing of messages and to control how they are logged. You will mostly interact with the Logger component as it will send your statements to the Appenders you have configured. Users can extend LogBox and build their own appenders and layouts.
