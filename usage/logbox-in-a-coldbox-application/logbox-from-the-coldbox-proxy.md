# LogBox from the ColdBox Proxy

The ColdBox Proxy \(`coldbox.system.remote.ColdboxProxy`\) object also has three utility methods you can use to talk to LogBox from any remote proxy you create:

* `getLogBox()` : Get a reference to the LogBox instance.
* `getRootLogger()` : Get a reference to the root logger.
* `getLogger(category:any)` : Get a named logger instance or reference.
